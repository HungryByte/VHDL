# VHDL

VHDL codebase for supporting assembly language programming of the MIPS processor. The single cycle Mips processor is able to handle the following instructions: 

          I-Type: ADDI, LW, SW, BEQ
          J-Type: J, JAL
          R-Type: ADD, SUB, SLL, SRL, JR, MUL, MULU, MFLO, MFHI, AND, OR, SLT
